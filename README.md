# NiceEngine

## Project purpose 
Build a 2D Game Engine inspired by [Hazel Engine](https://hazelengine.com/). 
*Hazel is a 2D and 3D Game Engine currently in development, made with education and simplicity in mind.*

## Features
- Easily create simple 2D games, e.g. mario, contra,...
- Image rendering support from OpenGL
- Support collision handling and physics
- Supports creating spritesheet-based game objects, e.g. game items, bricks,...
- Supports AudioManager from OpenAL
- Support 2D animation
- And more,.... (developing)

## Technology
- Java: the main language
- OpenGL: the Open graphic library help rendering
- Dear Imgui: graphic user interface library
- OpenAL: cross-platform 3D audio API
- ...

## Use tutorial of game Engine
#### Step 1: How to give a Game Object into the Game
- First, you have to choose a Object under the Object toolbar, then you move it to the screen where they have grid cell for design the Game.
- More, you can drag the mouse for add more Object on the screen by 2 ways are latitude and longitude ( red and green).

#### Step 2: Use component
- Toolbar on the right of screen. You can see the components of Object such as Transfor, RigidBody2D, Scripts of Object,.... they are in able to make object have ability like move to the left or right, top or bottom, or collision with the others. Like they can transfor like physical object.
#### Step 3: Create a script
- you can create a script for the object by Start function and Update funtion, make it can call different events each other, for the game become more reality.
- After that, you have to add the script into PropertiesWindow file in Editor folder, they can be call the script on the Game.
#### Step 4: Play the game

#### 1. Game object
#### 2. Rigidbody2D
#### 3. Transform
#### 4. Sprite Renderer
#### 5. 2D animation
#### 6. Sounds
#### 7. Spritesheet
#### 8. Updating....
